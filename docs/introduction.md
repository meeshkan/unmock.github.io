unmock is an opinionated and scalable way to mock external services in tests.

## What is unmock

Unmock is a JavaScript testing library that allows you to write comprehensive tests for third-party API integrations.

Inspired by libraries like [`nock`](https://github.com/nock/nock) and [`hoverfly`](https://github.com/spectolabs/hoverfly), Unmock aims to simplify the integration testing process by creating a small, isolated, ephemeral stack for every test that makes a network call. This stack represents the world outside your test, and is Just Good Enoughâ„¢ to reliably mock that world so that your tests pass when they should and, more importantly, fail when they should.

## How it works

Let's assume you want to fetch a GitHub organization's email address using `fetch`:

```js
async function fetchGitHubOrganizationEmail(organization) {
  const headers = new Headers({
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.ENV.GITHUB_API_TOKEN}`,
  });
  const organizationData = await fetch(
    `https://api.github.com/orgs/${organization}`,
    headers
  );
  return organizationData.email;
}
```

Your test looks like this:

```js
it("fetches GitHub organization's email", async () => {
  const email = await fetchGitHubOrganizationEmail("meeshkan");
  expect(email).toBe("contact@meeshkan.com");  // email address for Meeshkan organization
}
```

The test would complete successfully if the `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` environment variable was set properly. However, it is bad practice to hit the API in unit tests, because

1. running unit tests counts against the rate limit,
1. tests could change production data,
1. organization's email could change and that would break the test.

Let us add unmock to capture outgoing calls and check if the value returned from `fetchGitHubOrganizationEmail` is a `String`:

```js
import unmock from "unmock-node";

unmock.initialize();  // Capture outgoing calls

it("fetches GitHub organization's email", async () => {
  const email = await fetchGitHubOrganizationEmail("meeshkan");
  expect(typeof email).toEqual("string");
}
```

To describe what the GitHub service is, we add a yml file:

```yaml
# __unmock__/github/index.yml

servers:
  - https://api.github.com/

paths:
  /orgs/{org}:
    email: string!
```

The test passes now. If you're familiar with the OpenAPI specification, the contents of `index.yml` should look familiar to you, and indeed the file format is an extension of the OpenAPI specification. Read more about services and their specifications [here](services.md).

The specification for the `github` service defines the email address as any string. This may be all you need to test the function logic, but if you want the service to return a given email address instead of a random string, simply add a call to `states.github()` to modify the _state_ of the service:

```js
import unmock from "unmock-node";

const { states } = unmock.initialize();  // Capture outgoing calls

it("fetches GitHub organization's email", async () => {
  // Set the email address returned by the GitHub service:
  states.github({ email: "contact@meeshkan.com" });
  const email = await fetchGitHubOrganizationEmail("meeshkan");
  expect(email).toBe("contact@meeshkan.com");
}
afterAll(() => {
  unmock.reset();  // Reset the state
})
```

## Motivation

Services are the glue connecting modern applications: for example, the GitHub API is a service. Every service has a specification describing how the service behaves, be either written documentation, [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/), [RAML](https://raml.org/), or something else. The specification for a service is _reusable_ across applications.

Still, when testing how our applications integrate with external services, we rarely use the specifications directly. Instead, we write adhoc rules for how the services should behave. Writing such rules is error-prone, time-consuming, and hard to maintain.

This is what unmock wants to fix. Testing the integration with external services should start from the _service specification_. Setting the service _state_ should happen programmatically before every test. The state should be _consistent_ with the service specification.

## Mission

unmock wants to provide a semantically adequate, mocked version of the services in the internet so you never have to create a mock manually again. Before we get there, we provide best practices for testing external services.
