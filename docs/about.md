Unmock is created by a small team that co-owns, with some great investors, a company called Meeshkan. We build products that help people develop software that relies on external services, like REST APIs, databases, and IoT connections.

Meeshkan makes money by selling enterprise-grade testing services to its clients. Our clients make Unmock development possible, not only through their monetary support, but also through their usage and feedback.
