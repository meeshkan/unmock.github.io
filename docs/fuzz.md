Because Unmock generates random responses, it is not very useful to test out only one. The real power of Unmock comes from testing many different outcomes of interactions with an API.  To do this, `unmock` supports fuzz testing, or the testing of multiple random outcomes, with `unmock.runner`.

```javascript
import unmock, { u, transform, runner } from "unmock";
const { withCodes } = transform;

unmock
  .nock('https://api.myapi.com', 'myapi')
  .get('/user/{id}')
  .reply(200, {
    id: u.number(),
    name: u.string("name.firstName")
  })
  .get('/user/{id}')
  .reply(404, {
    message: "Naughty you!"
  })

const { myapi } = unmock.on().services;
myapi.state(withCodes(200));
test(() => runner(() => {
  // my test
}))
```

Runner generates a different response every time.  Had we not used `withCodes(200)`, `runner` would have randomly alternated between `200` and `404`.
