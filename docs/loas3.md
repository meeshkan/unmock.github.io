Often you have an OpenAPI specification available for a service. Mature projects and companies, such as Stripe and Slack, tend to have robust OpenAPI specifications that account for API corner cases and cover all API endpoints. However, if a specification is not available, you will need to deal with APIs that have incomplete or no OpenAPI documentation. In this case, you will need to author your own.

But fear not! Unmock can process [`loas3`](https://www.github.com/unmock/loas3), or Lazy OpenAPI 3, a syntactic superset of OpenAPI 3.0.0. This section gives a quick primer of the `loas3` specification. In addition to being easier to read and write, the specification usually results in documents that are 50% the size (or less!) of their more verbose OpenAPI counterparts.

## Cascading objects

Lazy Open API 3 allows you to omit information when you create a path, and provides sensible defaults when you do. The defaults work as follows.

```yaml
paths:
  /my-path:
    [get]:
      [responses]:
        [default]:
          [content]:
            [application/json]:
              [schema]:
                type: string
```

Thus:

```yaml
paths:
  /my-path:
    type: string
    default: foo
```

Is the same as

```yaml
paths:
  /my-path:
    get:
      responses:
        default:
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: string
                default: foo
```

## Schemas

`loas3` infers the schema from types if you provide an example of a return object. Thus:

```yaml
paths:
  /my-path: 1
```

Is the same as:

```yaml
paths:
  /my-path:
    get:
      responses:
        default:
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: integer
                format: int64
                default: 1
                example: 1
```

One gotchya is that, if you use one of the keywords that can actually be part of a [Schema Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#schemaObject), `loas3` will treat the object like a Schema.

::: tip
In unmock, `default` response is translated to a 200 response code.

## Parameters

In addition to the way parameters are expressed in OpenAPI, parameters can be specified in one of two lazy formats.

### Somewhat lazy

You can define `query`, `header`, `cookie` and `path` parameters as follows:

```yaml
paths:
  /my-path:
    get:
      parameters:
        query:
          foo: 1
        header:
          Authorization: { type: string }
```

Is the same as:

```yaml
paths:
  /my-path:
    get:
      parameters:
        - in: query
          name: foo
          schema:
            type: number
            format: int64
            default: 1
            example: 1
        - in: header
          name: Authorization
          schema:
            type: string
```

### Supremely lazy

For the unbearably, pathologically, irrecoverably lazy, you can just list the parameters as key-value pairs. They default to query unless they are in the enclosing path:

```yaml
paths:
  /my-path/{bar}:
    get:
      parameters:
        foo: 1
        bar: hello
```

Is the same as:

```yaml
paths:
  /my-path:
    get:
      parameters:
        - in: query
          name: foo
          schema:
            type: number
            format: int64
            default: 1
            example: 1
        - in: path
          name: bar
          schema:
            type: string
            default: hello
            example: hello
```
