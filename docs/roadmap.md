The roadmap for Unmock is quite ambitious, but we are committed to building a world-class testing tool that makes testing fun and helps developers in their day-to-day work.

Here are some highlights from our roadmap. The roadmap itself is open-sourced on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/unmock/unmock-docs), and we always appreciate comments and feedback.

## Three months

- Automatic initialization of the service directory structure
- Initialization options for `mocha` and `jest`
- A lightweight package management system for OpenAPI specifications

## Six months

- Publishing of a repository of curated OpenAPI specifications created by our Scala-based webscraper.

## One year

- Release of Unmock studio, a tool that makes it painless to create mock services by using natural language processing on recordings of API traffic and OpenAPI specifications.
